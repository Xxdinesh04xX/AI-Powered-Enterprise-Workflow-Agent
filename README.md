# AI-Powered Enterprise Workflow Agent

**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Dinesh Reddy  
**Date:** 10 Aug 2025

## Overview

An intelligent system that processes natural language business requests, automatically classifies and prioritizes tasks, assigns them to appropriate teams, and generates actionable reports to automate repetitive operational processes across IT, HR, and Operations workflows.

## Core Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Accept plain text requests and extract intent, priority, and actions
- **Intelligent Task Classification**: Categorize tasks into IT, HR, Operations with >90% accuracy
- **Automated Assignment Engine**: Map tasks to responsible teams using AI-driven logic
- **Report Generation**: Create structured reports with visual analytics and insights
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Classifier, Assignment, and Reporter agents working in coordination

## Technology Stack

- **LLM Integration**: Groq API, GPT-4, or LLaMA 3
- **AI Framework**: LangChain for agent orchestration
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Streamlit dashboard
- **Database**: SQLite (v1.0), designed for PostgreSQL scalability
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS for document retrieval

```

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Settings**
   ```bash
   cp config/settings.example.yaml config/settings.yaml
   # Edit settings.yaml with your API keys and preferences
   ```

3. **Initialize Database**
   ```bash
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

4. **Start Backend API**
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Launch Dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend/dashboard.py
   ```

## Primary Objectives

1. Automate workflow management from unstructured natural language requests
2. Implement AI agents to decompose multi-step business tasks into actionable items
3. Design for enterprise tool integration adaptability (ITSM, HR, Operations systems)
4. Achieve minimum 50% reduction in task handling time compared to manual processes

## Success Criteria

- **Classification Accuracy**: Minimum 90% on test datasets
- **Processing Time Reduction**: Minimum 50% compared to manual workflows
- **User Satisfaction**: Minimum 8/10 rating from trial users

## Use Cases

### IT Operations Teams
- Automated incident tracking and prioritization
- Example: "Find top 5 high-priority bugs from last week and assign to DevOps"

### HR Teams
- Leave request categorization and recruitment workflow automation
- Example: "Auto-categorize leave requests to prioritize urgent approvals"

### Operations Managers
- Automated weekly performance report generation
- Example: "Generate weekly performance reports without manual data collation"

## Version 1.0 Constraints

- Uses mock APIs instead of real-time enterprise tool integration
- Focus on workflow intelligence, not building full ITSM/HRMS platforms
- SQLite database for initial implementation

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time integration with enterprise tools (ServiceNow, Jira, Workday)
- Voice command support for workflow automation
- Auto-remediation suggestions for common operational issues
